1
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:58,426
Listen to me carefully, Carlito.

2
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:02,013
Rudy says Pachanga is complaining
about being broke;

3
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:04,640
that he doesn't have a single dollar.

4
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:08,144
He's also saying that you're a piece of shit,

5
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:12,106
and that you don't have the balls
to take care of the problem,

6
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,651
and he's wasted a lot of time
without making any money.

7
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:20,573
Besides, I hear he's spying on us for
Benny Blanco.

8
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:24,660
Let me deal with Pachanga.

9
01:41:27,289 --> 01:41:28,873
He's my brother.

10
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:33,169
He's your brother. That son of a bitch
would kill his mother for money.

11
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:39,634
See you tomorrow.
